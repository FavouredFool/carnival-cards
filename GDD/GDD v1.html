This deck of cards represents an entire story.</span></span><ul><li><span class="name"><span class="innerContentContainer">Example Story: Masked Ball in victorian times. Player represents a detective that goes undercover to solve a murder-mystery at the ball.</span></span></li></ul></li><li><span class="name"><span class="innerContentContainer">No card EVER goes missing on the table. It feels like a physical carddeck and all cards not currently relevant will still have to find their place on the table.</span></span></li><li><span class="name"><span class="innerContentContainer">Carddeck works recursively -&gt; Player starts at the Cover-Card and goes deeper and deeper into rooms which follow more rooms and people and objects and so on.</span></span></li><li><span class="name"><span class="innerContentContainer">The amount of things-to-uncover at any given point is made clear by the amount of cards that are still under any given card. F.e. all dialog cards are below a person that you can talk to. Therefore the player roughly knows how much they have to say by judging the height of the person-deck.</span></span></li><li><span class="name"><span class="innerContentContainer">The story is told through "Flavour"-Cards. Every card has some text that gives more information about the place they're in or the person they're speaking too. All objects that can be interacted at that card-position are also marked in the flavourtext</span></span></li><li><span class="name"><span class="innerContentContainer">To interact with the world, a player can make use of the "talk to", "investigate", and "sixth sense" interaction-cards. Not every interaction-card can be used with every card.</span></span><ul><li><span class="name"><span class="innerContentContainer">Using interaction-cards builds notoriety. The game is lost when a set amount of notoriety is reached due to the killer murdering the protagonist. Every interaction-card builds notoriety. Talk less than sixth sense. The player has to choose carefully with whom they speak and discern where it's useful to keep digging or what to let go.</span></span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><span class="name"><span class="innerContentContainer">Layouts</span></span><ul><li><span class="name"><span class="innerContentContainer">Different cards have different layouts associated with them.</span></span><ul><li><span class="name"><span class="innerContentContainer">A place f.e. has a "main card" which represents the place and also holds flavour-text on the backside. It also has a "back card" to jump out of the place and go back to the way the player came from. It has "fan cards" which are all child-cards of the card. They can be interacted with to present their layout with their cards. The last card is the "discard pile". It holds all cards that are not currently relevant to the place. Due to what is said in the premise, all cards need to exist somewhere on the table. </span></span><ul><li><span class="name"><span class="innerContentContainer">The discard pile always starts with the "cover-card" because the cards are always organized in a predefined way. While cards can break out of the chain and be displayed seperately, they can NEVER change the order. If they broke out, they will need to be resorted back to the exact place to not mess with the order of things. Therefore the discard pile can only ever start with the cover-card.</span></span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
